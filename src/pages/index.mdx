<img src={profileImg}/>

Hi there! My name is Minjun Park. I'm interested in machine learning focused on **Graph, Generative Process, and Interpretability**.
I completed my bachelor's degree on *Chemistry* and *Computer Science* in POSTECH.
My posts would be mainly about machine learning and python SW engineering.

## Research Experience

- **Motif-based 3D Molecule Generation Conditional on a Protein Binding Site.**
    - Advisor Prof. Dongwoo Kim at POSTECH(Sep. 2022 - Dec. 2022)
    - Extracted motifs of ligands by extracting [principal subgraphs](https://github.com/thunlp-mt/ps-vae).
    - Encoded binding site with GNN and autoregressively generated motifs based on [Pocket2Mol](https://github.com/pengxingang/Pocket2Mol)
- **Verify Safety Condition on Cyber Physical System via Rewriting Logic**
    - Advisor Prof. Kyungmin Bae at POSTECH(Mar. 2019 - June 2019)
    - Formalized a distributed drone system, and defined a domain-specific language for the control logic.
    - System modeling and verification were done using [maude](http://maude.cs.illinois.edu/w/index.php/The_Maude_System)
- **Anisotropic Scattering of Supercooled Water under OKE Condition**
    - Advisor Prof. Kyung Hwan Kim at Postech(July 2019 - June 2020)
    - Calibrated data from powder diffraction, implemented parallel data processing.

## Extracurricular Activity

- Startup Representative at *Cellfee* (Sep. 2017 - Oct. 2018)
    - I designed a baby powder milk capsules, compatible with Dolce Gusto coffee machines.
    - Won an award at [7-th Jung Joo Yong startup competiton](https://startup.asan-nanum.org/Summary?searchInfoID=9).
    - Won an awart at POSTECH tech. startup competition.
