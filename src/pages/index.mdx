# About Me

<div className={styles.profile}>
<img src={profileImg}/>

I am a Master's student specializing in AI at Seoul National University under the guidance of Professor Sungroh Yoon.
My academic journey began with a double major in Chemistry and Computer Science at POSTECH.
My current research interests lie in 3D reconstruction with prior knowledges in pretrained deep models.
Additionally, I am keen on keeping track of impactful recent deep learning architectures and have a growing interest in Explainable AI (XAI).
I am highly interested in open source projects. If you have any idea, feel free to contact me!

## Personal Interests

When I'm not immersed in my studies or research, I enjoy watching plays. My passion for the performing arts led me to join a drama club during my bachelor's degree, where I was an active member for seven years.

## Blog

### Focus
The main focus of my blog is paper reviews. I aim to bridge the gap between 3D graphics and deep learning communities by providing clear, plain-text explanations that help grasp core intuitions.

### Inspiration
Starting research was challenging for me due to the distinct differences between the 3D graphics and deep learning fields. I hope that my blog can serve as a helpful resource for future researchers, sparking ideas for potential collaborations.

## Extracurricular Activity

- **Startup Representative at Cellfee (Sep. 2017 - Oct. 2018)**
    - Designed a baby powder milk capsule compatible with Dolce Gusto coffee machines.
    - Won an award at the [7th Jung Joo Yong startup competition](https://startup.asan-nanum.org/Summary?searchInfoID=9).
    - Won an award at the POSTECH tech startup competition.
